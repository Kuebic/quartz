<b>Question:</b> How do you practice/learn praise songs? How are you learning so many songs when changing the set list every week? How do you spend your practice time?

- Learn the song first/listen to it before practicing the song
- Depends on current drumming competencies (can I actually play the song?)
  - Do you have the vocabulary? Can you play the groove/environment?
    - Example: If the song is a shuffle song but you've never played shuffle groove in your life, gotta learn to play the shuffle groove and appropriate fills before trying to learn the song
  - Can you play the groove up to speed?
- If you don't have time to practice the exact drum groove, simplify the song and play with the drumming vocabulary you do have and use a beat that works to support the song

- Limited way to learn the song: (not ideal)
  - Figuring out parts of the songs or get the notation and learn start to finish
  - This way you learn "a song"
- Better to learn the parts of the song
  - Learn general structure first, then add little details as you learn the song more
- Break it down in terms of the overall structure first - "Big Picture Sketch"
  - Write down the sections (Intro, Verse, Chorus, etc)
  - How many bars per section
  - Overall flow of piece of music
  - Identify the feel or the beat of each section

<b>Discusses</b> how to listen to the song, what to be listening for, and thinking of why the drummer is playing the way they are, and how we can adapt it to our own drumming style

- By breaking down songs into big-picture sections and understanding concepts for each section, can learn songs quickly
  - Not really learning songs, just the structure of them
  - TIP: learn the melody of the song
    - Helps learn the structure
    - Help you support the song musically
- Most churches have limited genres and styles
  - Once you learn the genres and styles, start to notice similarities and trends between the genres/styles
  - Once you know the typical song template, you only have to learn the differences
    - Example: most pop/rock songs have 8 bar sections. Only have to remember when sections aren't 8 bars.
- <b>TIP:</b> practice learning the song to a metronome
band depends on drummer to keep tempo
  - Drummer can't afford to be following anybody - everyone's following the drummer
    - Also have to be aware of structure as you dictate the flow when changing sections
  - Forces you to be familiar with melody and structure of the song
  - Metronome also helps identify slopping drumming

- How to organize practice time
  - Technical part
    - rudiments, hand speed, pad work, hand/foot work
    - non-musical repetitive necessities
  - Drum Vocabulary part
    - Groove environments
    - Fills
    - the musical side
  - Music/Musicality part
    - Learning songs
    - jamming to tracks
    - even away from kit
    - actively listening to songs
    - Identifying structure of song
    - identify what drummer is playing in each section of the song
    - why they're playing what they're playing (hardest part to learn/figure out but so rewarding)
- Depending on priority at that time, will change how long on each section
  - When just starting out
    - 3-5 hours Technical
    - For her now it's maintenance mode, so 10-15 minutes
  - If there's a show coming up
    - 90% of time working on songs
  - Always try to have all 3 sections for practice, just change amount of each time based on priority
