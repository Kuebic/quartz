Music directors are the glue that keep the band together. They are one step ahead at all times. They know what's around the corner and can clearly communicate to the band to make sure everyone knows where we're headed. They are hyper-focused and stay in tune with the worship leader to help lead the band where they need to go. Below are some keys to becoming an effective music director:

### Know Everyone's Parts

Music Directors need to know all the important parts of a song for all the instruments. They need to know what the Keys player is supposed to play in the bridge, what the drums are supposed to do for each section of each song, and any other key instrumentation for each arrangement. This means music directors have to really study up on the songs...not just learning their own parts, but knowing everyone else's. If you are music directing, please spend the time to really know the songs, the feel of the song, the song structure, the dynamics, and the key parts of the instrumentation.

### Error On Over-Communicating

If you're going to error, you want to error on the side of saying more, not less. It's better to say "Ending 2, 3, 4. Big Crash!" then just letting the band end. It's better to say "Bridge 2, 3, 4" then hope that they all remember. Other phrases: "Bass and cymbals", "cymbal swells", "Start the next song", "kill the click", etc. You are the director, so use the mic and give clear direction.

### Speak Early Enough

Make sure you are speaking early enough for the band to hear what you are saying, find the correct place on the chord chart and get their bearings. Don't be last minute. Communicate early...and be loud and clear.

### Key Phrases

Always start with the key phrase and then count. Use the key phrase as the one count (ex: "Sub on 4 .... 2, 3, 4).

"Break on (3)"

"Downchorus" = quiet chorus

"Sub on (4)"

"Impact on (1)"

"Riff" = short catchy hook

"Instrumental" = longer instrumental

"Drums Only"

"Cymbal swells"

â€‹"Shaker"

"Band in on (1)"
