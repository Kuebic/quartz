Electric guitar has become a key factor in modern worship music, and a lot of weight is put on electric guitarists to create the energy, character, and hooks of a song, both in tone and in style. 

We encourage our electric guitarists to take on a modern electric guitar tone and style, pulling from influences like U2 and Coldplay for inspiration. The key here is not shredding, but playing simple, rhythmic and melodic patterns, that don't distract from the vocal, lock in with the groove of the song, and help lift the song in the choruses. All new guitarists are required to watch the following training videos (listed below) before serving on the team.  You should be set up for modern worship styles and sounds. 

We would also encourage you to be listening to what is modern and current in worship music. Check out bands like Hillsong Worship, Elevation Worship, Vertical Worship, and Bethel to see what we are wanting from our guitarists. The key is simplicity, repetition, rhythmic and melodic patterns.
