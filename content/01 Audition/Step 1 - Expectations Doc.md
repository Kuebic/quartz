# Audition Expectations Guide
*For interested musicians and singers*
## Introduction
We're excited that you are interestd in being part of Minnesota Family Church's worship ministry. We've put together this guide to help you
1) Understand the expectations of worship team members, and
2) See what specifically we are evaluating during the audition process
## How We Think About Worship Leadership
At this church, anyone on stage, whether they are a worship leader, a singer, or a band member, is perceived as a leader of our church in some capacity. Consequently, we are interested in more than just musical ability when we add someone to our team.

When we assess someone to see if they are a good fit for our team, there are three values we have:

1) They must have good **character**.
2) They must be part of our **community**, or willing to become part of it.
3) They must be musicially **competent** and meet the standards we ask of our players.

### Leadership With Integrity
Our goal is to have a worship team that can minister with full integrity: a team that has good character, who belong to our church and are living in community and friendship with us, and who have the necessary skill to minister effectively.

The following pages go into further detail about each value and the kinds of questions that drive how we think of them.

#### 1. Character
**What character defects are problematic in worship ministry?**
- Laziness
- Viewing oneself as an exception to the rules
- Prima donna
- Over-sensitivity
- Inability to take instruction and / or correction
- Avoiding work considered beneath them
- Sinful lifestyle that dishonors God and True Parents
- Irritating, socially inept
- Unreliable: chronically late, no show/no call
- Unwilling to submit to authority (esp. when you disagree)

**What positive character traits are we looking for?**
- Reliability
- Humility: No agenda, coachable / Teachable, understand they are replaceable
- Respond well to others, to correction, to misaps
- Good work ethic: on time and prepared
- Devotion to Jesus, God, and True Parents
- God-honoring lifestyle (not perfection, but progressing in holiness)
- Understand and own the mission of Minnesota Family Church
- Honesty
- Selflessness

**Some "character" questions to consider (for your own reflection):
- Why do you want to be a part of this team?
- What does it mean for a musician to be coachable? Hard-working? Do you consider yourself hard-working and coachable?
- Look at this list of positive and negative character qualities. What is your greatest strength of character? Greatest weakness?
- What is your relationship with God like? Are you close to God or far away?
- Who is speaking into your life?
- How much of a need for attention do you have?
- If we needed you to sit out for a season, say two or three months, how would you respond to that?

#### 2. Community

**Our goal in community:**
- We want worship team members to be "part of our family"
- We do not prefer players who "just play" and exclude themselves from the life of the church
- We want team members to be relationally available for friendship outside of church
- This church has to be *your* church, and we want the privilege of walking with you and pastoring you to godly success.
- We want our team members to participate in weekly small groups

**Some "community" questions to consider (for your own reflection):**
- How long have you been attending Minnesota Family Church?
- In what ways are you currently involved in the life of the church?
- What is the Church to you?
- What is the importance of the Church to God?
