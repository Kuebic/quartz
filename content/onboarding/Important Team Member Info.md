## WORSHIP VOLUNTEER HANDBOOK

### **Welcome**

We are so excited that you've chosen to be a part of the Worship Ministry here at Minnesota Family Church! This will definitely be a rewarding, challenging and exciting experience for you.

This handbook is intended to give you the information you need to have a good understanding of what it means to be involved in this ministry.

### VISION/MISSION
We are a team that diligently seeks to
- CONNECT ourselves and our church family to God through worship, by cultivating a heavenly atmosphere on earth
- DEVELOP our God-given talents and abilities as we pursue excellence in our personal craft and artistry
- EMPOWER people to step into the fullness of their creative calling through music production, songwriting and leadership.

As members of this team we want to do all we can to serve the God and our Church well. It's a big commitment but well worth it!

### TIME COMMITMENT
#### As a volunteer of the Worship Ministry you are asked to commit to:

Serve for one service each month. Sometimes more, sometimes less depending on how scheduling pans out.

Be available to serve for service unless personal scheduling conflict makes it impossible.

Be available to jump in on a service you are not scheduled for, sometimes on short notice, if a scheduled volunteer can't make it. This doesn't happen frequently and is not a requirement but you may be asked.

Spend personal time preparing for rehearsal.

Lack of availability due to holidays, vacations and health issues, is understandable and will be taken into account, however a pattern of non-participation (including lack of availability and excessive substitutions) will require a reassessment of ministry involvement.

### SCHEDULING

Before the schedule is made you will be asked to post any block-out-dates for the upcoming month in Planning Center. Each Sunday you have not blocked out is a Sunday you may be scheduled.

A schedule is made for each month for each Sunday. It is emailed as a PDF a week before the beginning of each month.

Please carefully review the schedule, mark your personal calendar and notify and worship leader if you have any conflicts.

The week of the service you're scheduled for you will receive an invitation email from Planning Center to "confirm" your involvement. Given this process it is very rare to "decline" this invitation. If yo must decline please specify why to help the worship leader plan ahead.

### SUNDAY

#### 10AM Service
**SET LIST:** Posted to Planning Center at least the Wednesday before
**Location:** Sanctuary
**Rehearsal:** Thursday 6-8PM & Sunday 8-9AM

### REHEARSAL PREPARATION

Being prepared for rehearsal is very important. The set list is made available several days in advance to give you the most time possible to prepare. Although everyone prepares differently, your preparation should look something like this:

- Look through the appropriate charts from Planning Center
- Listen to each song, taking notes on parts and dynamics
- Spend time working out your specific parts
- Make notes in Music-Stand app
- Work towards memorizing songs

Even for experienced musicians and singers this process can take about 30 minutes per song so please plan ahead.

When arriving at rehearsal you will be expected to have your parts worked out. Not coming prepared wastes the time of the team and decreases the quality of the music.

Please arrive 10-15 minutes before rehearsal begins to get set up and prepared. We'll begin promptly at the rehearsal time. For example, please arrive 5:45pm for the 6:00pm rehearsal.

### [[Planning Center]]

Planning Center is the internet based planning program we use at Calvary. Here's what you'll need to know and some tips for getting the most out of Planning Center.

The worship leader will set up your account.

Each week you are scheduled you will receive an invitation for the service. Please click "confirm". This will take you to the service plan and also notify the worship leader you're good to go.

Under the "Plans" tab find the appropriate service. Each song will contain a chart, an MP3 and notes for specific people. Please read the notes carefully.

Some songs have charts in multiple keys. Be sure to print the correct one.

If there are dates you know you will be unavailable please post them as "block-out dates" on your Planning Center calendar for the worship leaders to reference.

### SERVICE PREPARATION

All team members are required to participate with the congregation during the service. Please be engaged and prepared to close with a worship song.

#### ATTIRE

**Key:** Don't be distracting
- No worn or torn clothings that is ripped or frayed
- No hoodies or extremely casual clothing
- Dress sandals are okay

Modesty is a must. If you are questioning a particular outfit please choose something else

### COMMUNICATION

As a team member communicating with your worship leader is very important. Here are a few things to be sure to communicate.

Email is our main method of communication. Please check your email regularly.

If you are going to be late to rehearsal text or call the worship leader as soon as you can. If we haven't heard from you we'll give you a call to make sure you're on your way.

If there are certain dates you will not be available to participate please specify on your Planning Center calendar.

If a situation comes up during a week you are scheduled and you cannot attend a rehearsal or service inform the worship leader ASAP. They may choose to schedule a different person.

If you need help, counseling, or prayer for any reason please let us know. One of the best parts of being part of this ministry is enjoying the prayer and support of your team.

When not in use, please leave your ear buds in the drawer. This will keep them from being misplaced (they are actually quite expensive believe it or not). Also, please refrain from leaving them on the stage floor between sets, either take them with you or hang them on your stand. This will prevent people from accidentally stepping on them.

**Other:** Please inquire about other instruments and gear.
